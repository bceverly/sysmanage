SysManage is a comprehensive centralized system management platform that
provides real-time monitoring, management, and control of Linux and BSD
systems through a web-based interface.

The server component consists of:
  * Python-based backend using FastAPI and WebSockets
  * React-based frontend with Material-UI
  * PostgreSQL database for data persistence
  * Real-time agent communication via secure WebSockets
  * Multi-language support (14 languages)
  * Role-based access control (RBAC)
  * Package management across multiple Linux distributions
  * System monitoring and metrics collection
  * Remote command execution with audit logging
  * Certificate and secret management
  * Firewall configuration management

SysManage Server coordinates with SysManage Agent instances deployed on
managed systems to provide centralized visibility and control across your
infrastructure.

The server requires PostgreSQL and serves both the API backend and the
static frontend files. It communicates securely with agents using TLS-
encrypted WebSocket connections.
